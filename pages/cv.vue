        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy conceptualising and creating solutions to challanges that people face, while keeping technical complexity as managable as possible. I understand in the importance of putting people at the centre of everything I create, and work with others to create.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love learning and challenging myself. I consider myself a fast learner, and am confident in picking up new languages and skills that pique my interest. You can see some of my side projects on <a href="https://github.com/siddv" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>.
